# Cyclist Bike Share SQL Project

## Introduction
This project analyzes bike-sharing data to uncover usage patterns and user behavior, providing insights to enhance service delivery. The analysis was conducted using SQL for data manipulation and querying and Tableau was used for data visualization. For detailed documentation, visit the [full project on Medium](https://medium.com/@chelagattabitha6/cyclist-bike-sharing-sql-project-ff4822d76836).

## Questions to Answer
1. What are the peak usage times for bike-sharing services?
2. Which locations have the highest demand for bikes?
3. How does user type (casual vs. member) affect usage patterns?

## Steps Followed
- Data extraction and import into SQL database
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using SQL queries
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) through SQL
- Aggregation and calculation of key metrics
- Creation of visualizations for insights
- Deriving key findings and recommendations

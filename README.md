# Cyclist Bike Share SQL Project

## Introduction
This project analyzes bike-sharing data to uncover usage patterns and user behavior, providing insights to enhance service delivery. The analysis was conducted using SQL for data manipulation and querying and Tableau was used for data visualization. For detailed documentation, visit the [full project on Medium](https://medium.com/@chelagattabitha6/cyclist-bike-sharing-sql-project-ff4822d76836).

## Questions to Answer
1. What are the peak usage times for bike-sharing services?
2. Which locations have the highest demand for bikes?
3. How does user type (casual vs. member) affect usage patterns?

## Steps Followed
- Data extraction and import into SQL database
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using SQL queries
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) through SQL
- Aggregation and calculation of key metrics
- Creation of visualizations for insights
- Deriving key findings and recommendations

Your key findings and recommendations are insightful and can effectively guide strategies to enhance ridership and membership. Here's a refined and structured presentation of your key points and suggestions:

### Key Findings:

1. **Membership Matters**:
   - **Rides Contribution**: Annual members contribute significantly more rides (61.86%) compared to casual riders, highlighting the value of membership programs.

2. **Ride Duration**:
   - **Casual vs. Members**: Contrary to expectations, casual riders have a longer average ride duration (22.4 minutes) compared to members (11.9 minutes). This suggests casual riders might be using the bikes for leisure or longer trips.

3. **Bike Preference**:
   - **Classic Bikes**: Both member and casual riders overwhelmingly favor classic bikes, with over 2 million rides attributed to this type.

4. **Riding Patterns**:
   - **Weekend Warriors**: Casual riders exhibit a strong preference for weekend riding (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) with less usage on weekdays. This suggests they might be using the bikes for recreational purposes.

### Recommendations:

1. **Targeted Incentives for Casual Riders**:
   - **Incentives for Membership**: Encourage casual riders to become members by offering incentives that address their longer ride duration. Possible strategies include:
     - Tiered discounts based on ride time.
     - Offering longer free ride periods with memberships.

2. **Weekday Usage Promotion**:
   - **Increase Weekday Rides**: To boost weekday usage, consider offering:
     - Promotions or discounts for weekday rides.
     - Targeting casual riders who might use the service for commuting.

3. **Content and Partnerships**:
   - **Promote Scenic Routes**: Partner with local businesses or create content that promotes scenic routes or interesting weekday destinations accessible by bike. This can incentivize casual riders to explore the service beyond weekends.

4. **Station Analysis**:
   - **Popular Stations**: Investigate the reasons behind the popularity of Streeter Dr & Grand Ave for casual riders and Kingsbury St & Kinzie St for members. Determine if these stations are near leisure areas or business hubs to guide:
     - Future station placement.
     - Targeted marketing strategies.

# Cyclist Bike Share SQL Project

## Introduction
This project analyzes bike-sharing data to uncover usage patterns and user behavior, providing insights to enhance service delivery. The analysis was conducted using SQL for data manipulation and querying and Tableau was used for data visualization. For detailed documentation, visit the [full project on Medium](https://medium.com/@chelagattabitha6/cyclist-bike-sharing-sql-project-ff4822d76836).

## Questions to Answer
1. What are the peak usage times for bike-sharing services?
2. Which locations have the highest demand for bikes?
3. How does user type (casual vs. member) affect usage patterns?

## Steps Followed
- Data extraction and import into SQL database
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using SQL queries
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) through SQL
- Aggregation and calculation of key metrics
- Creation of visualizations for insights
- Deriving key findings and recommendations

## Key Findings
- **Peak Usage Times:** Most rides occur during morning and evening rush hours.
- **High-Demand Locations:** Central business districts and major transit hubs.
- **User Patterns:** Members use the service more consistently, while casual users show higher activity on weekends.

## Actions / Recommendations
- **Service Expansion:** Increase bike availability at high-demand locations during peak times.
- **Membership Promotion:** Implement campaigns to convert casual users to members.
- **Infrastructure Improvement:** Enhance bike lane infrastructure in high-traffic areas to support increased usage.
